### Hi there 👋

* 🏢 I'm working [**@jolicode**](http://github.com/jolicode) as a web developer
* 🔭 I use PHP (Symfony), Golang, and JavaScript (React)
* 🛠 I like working with PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Redis, Elasticsearch
* ⌨ I do OPS with Docker, Ansible and I use to consul, packer, and chef

But I'm doing some open source:
